# eYantra Luminosity Drone 2023
The eYantra competition, an international robotics event hosted by IIT Bombay, challenges participants with gamified problem statements, known as Themes. This prestigious competition offers the opportunity to work with various advanced technologies, including the Robot Operating System (ROS), drone control, image processing, 3D designing, embedded systems, control systems design, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) programming, remote sensing, and more.

Our team, consisting of four members with myself as the team leader, participated in the Luminosity Drone challenge.
Our primary objective was to detect alien species using various image processing techniques.

Task 1 was primarily on PID tuning of the drone to stabilize at a particular point, also using OpenCV to detect bright spots in a given image.
Task 2 was to use appropriate path planning algos and navigate across the Arena and detect those species(marked as a bright spot) and then send the coordinates to the base station.

The tasks were to be done using ROS and was simulated in Gazebo environment.
